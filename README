The purpose of Society is to create a decentralized network where users can share both data and processor time  with each other. Each user would actually be represented by the 'cloud' of devices that they own which are running nodes on the network (farms in linked process terms). Each node would provide different services (villeins) that could then be shared to friends or pooled. The goal of this project is to produce a robust, decentralized, trust-linked network of users and their devices.
